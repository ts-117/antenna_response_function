Together with the antenna group in Southern Universtiy of Science and Tehcnology: Xianming Zheng, Qingbao He, Xuanyu Shang, Shi Tao and Qingyang Dong

We carried out a series of experiments to determine the response function of the double probe antenna
we take the experiment in water in order to simulate the space plasma environment
We put the antenna in a vat filled with conductive water to imitate plasma and generate the electric field by two parallel metal plates, one connected to the signal generator which send out sine waves in different frequencies(0.1 Hz~40 MHz) and the other connected to the ground. By reading the peak-to-peak value of the voltage measured by an oscilloscope at different positions in the water, we can then obtain the background electric field by calculating the slope of potential as a function of length (the distance between the probe and the positive plate). Comparing the background electric field and the measured one on the double probe antenna at different frequencies, we can derive the response function.
